    "Applications of Trie - \n",
    "\n",
    "-> autocomplete. Once you've typed in a letter, the tree of potential words is greatly reduced, allowing the program to easily enumerate what kinds of strings are possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> the trie can store additional information for each word. For example, the trie can store how popular a word might be. That's why when you type \"ye\", \"yes\" is suggested before \"yelling\".\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Tries are also useful for approximate matching algorithms, like those used in spell check. A slightly misspelled word will have a similar path from the root of the tree when compared with the correctly spelled word. This is especially true if certain modifications are made to the trie, like branch merging.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> String matching is another use case where tries and approximation algorithms are useful. Longest suffix or prefix matching uses these methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Tries can also be used for sorting. Using a trie to do this is similar to radix sort. A pre-order traversal of the tree will result in an output that is in increasing order, allowing sorting."
